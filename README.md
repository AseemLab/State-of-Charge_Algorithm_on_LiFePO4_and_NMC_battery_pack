## Overview

This project implements an advanced State of Charge estimation algorithm using artificial neural networks combined with boosting algorithms. The system processes real Battery Management System (BMS) data to predict battery SoC with higher accuracy than conventional methods like Coulomb counting and voltage-based techniques.

### Key Objectives
- Develop machine learning models for precise SoC estimation
- Handle complex, nonlinear battery behavior patterns
- Account for temperature variations and charge/discharge cycles
- Compare multiple algorithmic approaches for optimal performance

##  Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Approach**: Combines ANN with XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bayesian Ridge
- **Real BMS Data Processing**: Handles 30+ GB of high-frequency battery data
- **Temperature Compensation**: Accounts for thermal variations in battery performance
- **Robust Data Pipeline**: Advanced preprocessing and feature extraction
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using MSE and validation curves
- **Battery Chemistry Specific**: Optimized for both LiFePO4 and NMC batteries
